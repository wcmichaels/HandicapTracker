# HandicapTracker

This application keeps golf statistics for individual players.  Players are able to select a course and can log rounds in their profile.  The application is able to calculate a player's WHS index.  Additionally, players have the option to log stats for each hole in a round (examples include: hole score, number of putts, if hit fairway).  HandicapTracker is an ASP.NET Core Web API written in C# with a SQL Server database.  Next steps are to continue building out funcionality in the API as well converting from a command-line interface to a Vue.js web front-end.
